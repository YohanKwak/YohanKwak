Design:
Powerups - Our powerups are a freeuse dead rat image for the snakes to collect.
Background - Our background is a freeuse grass resource from the web.
Snakes - Our snakes are standard rounded line strokes, Nine unique colors are assigned by snake ID.
Walls - Our walls are a segment of a freeuse brick wall image from the web.

Features:
We have implemented world wrapping for snakes.
Our snakes display username and score below their head, moving with the snake. The text color is black.
Custom images and art for powerups, walls, and background.
To the best of our ability, all required features were implemented. Everything was tested and works well.
Most errors are handled, including disconnecting from server and the entering of an incorrect IP. The user is allowed to retry with a correct IP address.
In the event that the server closes, the user is informed they were disconnected via popup, and their game pauses permanently.
