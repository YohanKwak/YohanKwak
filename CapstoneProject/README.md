# Pantry Helper

## Description
Our capstone project, Pantry Helper, addresses difficulties and inefficiencies in food pantry operations, making processes smoother for both pantries and donors. Pantry Helper simplifies operations for pantries while providing donors with a more seamless experience. Our solution aims to alleviate operational challenges, ultimately improving the efficiency and effectiveness of food pantry operations.

Pantry Helper is a web-based inventory application designed to help food pantries, specifically the Feed U Pantry at the University of Utah, streamline their donation management process.The application provides a user-friendly interface for recording incoming donations, tracking outgoing food distribution, and generating insightful data analysis reports. Pantry Helper's data analysis features help food pantries identify patterns in donation trends and popular items,enabling them to make informed decisions about future inventory needs and fundraising efforts. The data analysis will also gather data regarding what items are expiring so that future donations will lead to more distributions and less waste. It will also monitor items that are low in stock, encouraging donors to contribute the needed items. 

Additionally, the application's automated email system fosters positive relationships between donors and recipients by allowing recipients to express their gratitude directly to the donors, potentially encouraging repeat donations. Pantry Helper automates tedious inventory management tasks and provides valuable data insights, which empowers food pantries to operate more efficiently and effectively.

By simplifying the donation process, this will ultimately enable them to serve their communities to a greater extent. This project is a perfect capstone project as it addresses a real-world need within the food pantry community. The project is feasible, impactful, and has the potential to make a significant difference in the lives of those who rely on food pantries for assistance.

- React.js
- Ant Design
- Axios
- Recharts
- Moment.js
- XLSX
- React Grid Layout

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure the following are installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or above) and npm: [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git**: [Download](https://git-scm.com/)
- **MySQL**: [Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)

---

## Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd pantry-helper-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `pantry-helper-frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   Add the following:
   ```dotenv
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **Run the frontend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   By default, the frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd pantry-helper-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `pantry-helper-backend` directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   Add the following:
   ```dotenv
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=your_db_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_NAME=your_db_name
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Start the MySQL database**:
   Ensure your MySQL server is running. Create the required database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE pantry_helper;
   ```

5. **Run the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   By default, the backend will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

---

## Running the Application

To run the full application:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd pantry-helper-backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend server in a new terminal:
   ```bash
   cd pantry-helper-frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Environment Variables

### Frontend

Add the following to the `pantry-helper-frontend/.env` file:

```dotenv
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Backend

Add the following to the `pantry-helper-backend/.env` file:

```dotenv
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name
PORT=5000
```

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Module not found errors**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed in both the `pantry-helper-frontend` and `pantry-helper-backend` directories:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

2. **Database connection issues**:
   - Check your `.env` file for correct database credentials.
   - Ensure the MySQL server is running.

3. **CORS issues**:
   - Ensure the backend is configured to accept requests from the frontend's origin.

4. **Port conflicts**:
   - Change the `PORT` variable in the `.env` file for the backend.
   - Use the following command to start the frontend on a different port:
     ```bash
     PORT=3001 npm start
     ```

5. **Layout overlapping issues**:
   - Clear browser cache or refresh the application.

6. **API issues**:
   - Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to debug backend API endpoints.

## Additional Notes

- **API Documentation**:
  The backend includes Swagger for API documentation. You can access it at:
  ```
  http://localhost:5000/api-docs
  ```

- **Version Compatibility**:
  Ensure you have Node.js 14+ and npm installed. Check your versions using:
