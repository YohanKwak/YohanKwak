Additonal Features: We implemented a label that displays dependent cells.
Additionally, we implemented three buttons that allow the user to copy, paste, and move cell contents.
Important Design Decisions: 
Choosing to implement everything in a grid system, allowing for even spacing and easy addition of new UI elements.
Choosing to display cell name, value, and contents at the top of the screen.
Choosing to put additional features (mentioned above) at the bottom of the screen.
Choosing to make the help menu a flyoutmenu with popups for each explanation.
Choosing to make contents scale with the screen.
Choosing to save invalid formulas as a string.
